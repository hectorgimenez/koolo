## Requirements
- Diablo II: Resurrected (1280x720 required, windowed mode, ensure accessibility large fonts disabled)
- **Diablo II: LOD 1.13c** (IMPORTANT: It will **NOT** work without it, this step is not optional)

## Quick Start
### Preparing the character
- Koolo will read game keybindings in order to use the skills, doesn't matter what key is used, but the skills for the build must be set.
- For blizzard sorceress, set the **left** skill to Glacial Spike or Ice Blast, and for Hammerdin to Blessed Hammer.
- Foh set keybind for FOH and holybolt on left skill, conviction on right skill
- Berserk barb set berserk as left skill. Also to use FindItem you need higher goldfind on secondary weapons slot. Alibaba + anything will work.
- Buy TP and ID tomes and one stack of keys and keep them in the inventory, additionally set the TP tome to a key binding, this is **required**.
- Horadric Cube can be stashed or kept in inventory, Koolo will use it to cube recipes if enabled.
- Keep the charms in the inventory, Koolo can be configured to lock specific inventory slots.

### Running the tool
- If you haven't done yet, install **Diablo II: LOD 1.13c** (required)
- [Download](https://github.com/hectorgimenez/koolo/releases) the latest Koolo release (recommended for most users), or alternatively you can [build it from source](#development-environment)
- Extract the zip file in a directory of your choice.
- Run `koolo.exe`.
- Follow the setup wizard, it will guide you through the process of setting up the bot, you will need to setup some directories and character configuration.
- If you want to back up/restore your configuration, and for manual setup, you can find the configuration files in the `config` directory.

## Pickit rules
Item pickit is based on [NIP files](https://github.com/blizzhackers/pickits/blob/master/NipGuide.md), you can find them in the `config/{character}/pickit` directory.

All the .nip files contained in the pickit directory will be loaded, so you can have multiple pickit files.

There are some considerations to take into account:
- If item fully matches the pickit rule before being identified, it will be picked up and stashed unidentified.
- If item doesn't match the full rule, will be identified and checked again, if fully matches a rule it will be stashed otherwise sold to vendor.
- If there is an error on the NIP file or Koolo can not understand it, the application will not start.
- Pickit rules can not be changed in runtime (yet), you will need to restart Koolo to apply changes.

## Development environment
**Note:** This is only required if you want to build the project from source. If you want to run the bot, you can just download the [latest release](https://github.com/hectorgimenez/koolo/releases).

Setting the development environment is pretty straightforward, but the following dependencies are **required** to build the project.

### Dependencies
- [Download Go >= 1.23](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Install git](https://gitforwindows.org/)

### Building from source
Open the terminal and run the following commands in project root directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/hectorgimenez/koolo.git
cd koolo
build.bat
```
This will produce the "build" directory with the executable file and all the required assets.

### Updating with latest changes
In order to fetch latest `main` branch changes run the following commands in project root directory:
```shell
git pull
build.bat
```
**Note**: `build` directory **will be deleted**, so if you customized any file in there, make sure to backup it before running `build.bat`.
